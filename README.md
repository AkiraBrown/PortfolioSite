# **Akira brown Portfolio Site**

### Welcome to my portfolio site!

On this site, I'll be conveying my thoughts and feelings about my coding journey while also showcasing my projects. Often, developers maintain a very static approach with their portfolio sites, creating an impressive design initially. Even though that can add the **WOW** factor to any portfolio, it doesn't incentivize updating the portfolio.

_Sooo...._

I decided to structure this site in a way to make it easy for me to keep updating this site using markdown. Any questions?

### Why Markdown?

Thanks for asking; the reason for using markdown is because markdown is the de facto markup language for most developer documentation no matter what tech field your in. Also I prefer the github look so it made sense. With this in mind, I created a backend that will serve markdown files to my frontend and the frontend will convert that into it's appropiate HTML tags.
